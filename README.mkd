Generate C++ Boilerplate
========================

I turned the shell scripts I habitually use to create new C++ files into
a simple little PHP web app so my colleagues that aren't always in Linux
can start the good habit too.

Requirements
------------

* Needs PHP 5.3 or newer. (uses anonymous functions)

* You may wish to use [git-deploy][] to push to production, though since
this is such a simple little set of php scripts it may be overkill. I've
done the `git deploy init` task already, you just need to do the other
ones listed on the git-deploy page.

Configuration
-------------
You'll probably want to fork and tweak things, and that's OK. The files
in `templates` are one place to start. The main actual templating code
takes place in `generate.php`.

You can run `./test-locally` if you have the `php` command installed to
simulate a web hit without needing to set up apache and PHP.
